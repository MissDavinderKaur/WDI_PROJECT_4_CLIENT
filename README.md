# WDI\_PROJECT\_4: Let's Talk (API)

## Overview
The brief for Final Project was to build a project that defined us - no pressure! - so breaking down the things that make me “me”, I ended up with the following list: 
* Growing up as a British Asian in the UK, I have been incredibly lucky with the opportunities presented to me but it has come with certain challenges. 
* When I feel supported, I feel empowered to follow my goals - and it is my passion to help people feel empowered to achieve. 
* I love talking 
Combining all three of these points into an app idea, it felt natural to build an Instant Messaging app centred around supporting people through issues they may be experiencing in the workplace. 

The application can be found here

## Code Overview
Having learnt from a previous project that a well defined data model was core to the successful build of a project, I spent a long time working through the details and building the RESTful endpoints for the models. Once complete, I walked through the user story multiple times to connect up the various parts of the app and build a smooth user experience. This was MVP. And so it was time for frills: email notifications and instant messaging. 

## Successes
Adding in the two features, that would change the app from a simple message board to a proper messaging app, was a really big win for me.
Although not logic heavy, these two features were tricky to build due to the configuration required (EmailHelper and ActionCable, respectively) to implement successfully. The biggest personal win for me was styling the app: having not been able to make anything look very pretty for the duration of the course, building a clean interface using Pure CSS framework, which enhanced the user story was a mini-fist-pump moment for me! 

## Challenges
If I had the opportunity to build the app again, I would have wireframed the application better - as with the build of team:up, I should have correctly templated the the required HTML views with dummy data, before adding the logic to them. This would have made styling easier!
 
## Next Steps
There are so many features that can be added to this application: where conversations need to be had face-to-face, there could be a "Set up meeting" feature that would suggest a public location based on the user's current locations. Also it would be great to ad din support for emojis!
